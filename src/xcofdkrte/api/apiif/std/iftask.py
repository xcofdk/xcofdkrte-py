        Request to start this task.

        Passed in positional and/or keyword arguments (if any) will be passed
        to either one of the phasedXF callbacks below:
            - setup phase if configured,
            - run phase otherwise.

        Parameters:
        -------------
            - args_ :
              positional arguments (if any).
            - kwargs_ :
              keyword arguments (if any).

        Returns:
        ----------
            True if the operation succeeds, False otherwise.

        Note:
        ------
            - A request to start a synchronous task is always a synchronous,
              i.e. blocking, operation. Note that synchronous tasks can only be
              started from within the currently running host thread. That is,
              the requester will be blocked until the execution of task's 3-PhXF
              is finished.

            - For asynchronous tasks the operation is non-blocking, it returns
              right before the execution of task's 3-PhXF is going to take place.
              That is, the actual execution of such a task is always performed
              asynchronously.

            - Right after start, a synchronous task immediately is in state
              'running'.

            - For an asynchronous task, however, it is in principle in a pending
              state (for a short while) until its execution effectively takes
              place. The duration of that pending state is out of the control of
              the framework, it basically is controlled by the (scheduling
              mechanism of the) host operating system and/or host programming
              language. In the latter case due to GIL (if enabled) for example.

            - Below simplified code snippet (for debug mode of a Python program)
              may be of some help for better understanding of the start
              operation (as long as there is no LC failure present):
                  >>>
                  >>> def StartMyTask(tsk_ : ITask) -> bool:
                  >>>     #ASSUMPTION:
                  >>>     #  - Passed in 'tsk_' is an instance of the interface class IRCTask.
                  >>>
                  >>>     # make sure interpreter's debug mode is not turned off
                  >>>     if not __debug__:
                  >>>         return False
                  >>>
                  >>>     assert tsk_.isAttachedToFW
                  >>>     assert not tsk_.isStarted

                  >>>     if not tsk_.Start():
                  >>>         # the operation failed for whatever reason
                  >>>         return False
                  >>>
                  >>>     # now, the 'isStarted' property will always pass the assertion
                  >>>     assert tsk_.isStarted

                  >>>             # still in pending state?
                  >>>             if tsk_.isPendingRun:
                  >>>                 # if ever, this should happen for a very short time only, so stay in the loop
                  >>>                 continue
                  >>>
                  >>>             # task is not waiting for its initial CPU assignment anymore, leave the loop
                  >>>             break
                  >>>
                  >>>         # task is in either one of the states below
                  >>>         assert tsk_.isRunning or tsk_.isTerminating or tsk_.isTerminated
                  >>>
                  >>>         # wait for the task to finish its work (if still running)
                  >>>         tsk_.Join()
                  >>>
                  >>>     # now, the task is in either one of the states below
                  >>>     assert tsk_.isDone or tsk_.isCanceled or tsk_.isFailed
                  >>>
                  >>>     return True

            - Unless for the purpose of advanced, application-specific
              synchronization of quite many tasks started in a row, in practice
              the task state 'isPendingRun' should rarely be observable by
              applications, so it usually doesn't need to be considered at all.

            - But, if ever troubling, it in fact represents a typical race
              condition related to the possibly needed synchronization between
              both the caller and the callee host threads. Releasing the CPU
              by the caller for a short time is a common approach when dealing
              with start of host threads. Same other approach may also resolve
              similar problems with start of task instances, too, as depicted
              below:
                  >>> from time   import sleep
                  >>> from typing import List
                  >>>
                  >>> def StartAsyncTasks(pool_ : List[ITask]):
                  >>>     for tt in pool_:
                  >>>         tt.Start()
                  >>>
                  >>>     # sleep for a proper amount of time, e.g. 20 [ms]
                  >>>     sleep(0.02)

            - Requests to stop tasks which are terminated or in a transitional
              state of termination (i.e. stopping, canceling) already are
              ignored by the framework.
            - A request to stop a task is always a non-blocking instruction to
              stop the task. It simply notifies the task about the stop request
              and returns.
            - Detaching a task from the framework causes that task to be stopped
              by the framework as well (if still running).
            - Upon initiating the shutdown sequence, and whenever the RTE
              configuration 'ForcedAutoStop' is enabled, the framework always
              asks running tasks to stop their execution via this API function,

        ------
            - Canceling a task is an API function reserved for use by
              applications only, the framework never makes any use of it.
            - Its major purpose is to provide applications with their own
              logical and/or functional attribution of the execution result of
              a task which is terminated, but not failed (i.e. having caused
              any LC failure). Such an attribution might look like below:
                  - DONE     : finished or stopped the job as expected, or
                  - CANCELED : not failed, but broken for whatever

            - A request to cancel a task is always a non-blocking instruction

            - Detaching a task from the framework by intention and before its

              task (if applicable).
            - As soon as a task is detached from the framework, it won't be able
              to use the full set of its reqular API anymore. Its task state

            - A task is no longer in 'running' state once it reaches its
              transitional state 'terminating', especially when leaving its
              (cyclic) run phase.
            - Thus, tasks are particularly not in the state of 'running' anymore
              whenever they enter their teadown phase (if configured).
            - Also, as soon as a (submitted) fatal error becomes qualified, the
              affected task instance leaves its 'runnig' state, too.

            - In all other cases where a task is already associated with its
              current user/fatal error, submitting subsequent errors (of the
              same error type as the current error) for that task does not
              touch its current user/fatal error.

              In other words, unless current error is resolved (or cleared),
              it cannot be overwritten. This way, current error is kind of
              'very first error' of the respective phase (cycle) of 3-PhXF.

            - However, corresonding setter operations (see below) may be used
              by a task to set or replace its current error.

    def SelfCheck(self) -> bool:

        Request to perform a self-check of this instance.

        The major purpose of self-check is to ensure that the task state is
        always up-to-date, especially after a time-consuming operation done
        by the application within its 3-PhXF.

        Returns:
        ----------
            - True if:
                  - the instance is not started yet, or
                  - this instance is being executed right now with its execution

        Note:
        ------
            - If called for a task instance which is not the currently running
              task, then the last available operation result of that task will
              be returned.

              is set to 'stopping' (if not terminated or terminating already).

                  - as long as this instance is in state 'running', then its
                    execution can continue,
                  - if within the teardown phase, then its execution can
